## Key

- Unused Desks: An unused desk is a desk which is not occupied for an entire day. To account for potential errors desks have been classified as unused where desk utilisation in the sample period is less than 15%, and there are fewer than 2 occurrences of that desk being occupied for 30-minute stretches during the day.
- Under Utilised Desks: For the purposes of this report an under utilised desk is a used desk which is used for less than 50% of the time during the day.
- In use: a desk is used for more than 50% of the day.

- A note on Multiple Occupancy: It is not possible within the main data to identify instances where more than one individual has occupied a single desk. However the absence of activity at a desk for an extended period of time does indicate sub-optimal utilisation of desk space.
